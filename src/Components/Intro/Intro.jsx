        <p>I am a former food scientist turned software engineer. While working in the food industry I discovered my enjoyment of coding and developing new applications while I was in between contract roles working in the food industry. While I was working in the food industry I often would realize that a lot of the methods they would use for tracking things could be automated in some way or form. After my last role in the food industry, the COVID-19 pandemic came and I was at a cross-roads, to which I decided on career changing into Software Engineering.</p>
        <p> After graduating from coding bootcamp, I went to work at a large Telecommunications company and a Big 4 accounting firm's design studio. In these roles I worked with modern Javascript frameworks such as React and Angular, and learned a lot about accessibility and gained an eye for design. One of the reasons why I enjoy coding and developing new products is because I believe that code is an art form its a way to express yourself and show off what you enjoy, while also being able to solve problems which is something that most people can see in a lot of the projects I like to build. </p>
        <p>I do other things besides code too! I am a competitive powerlifter in the USAPL where I also serve as a state referee volunteering at meets. I also attend various anime conventions throughout the year either by staffing them or by attending as a panelist. You could also find me online playing video games and watching anime!</p>
