I went to a coding bootcamp during the height of COVID then later went on to work in front end development in both React and Angular, during my time working in front end development. Working in front end development, I ended up working with designers as well and gained some skills in design through them. While also practicing my development skills, I also continued to develop my skills in design with prototyping and making wireframes, while also learning more about UX research. My abilities in both design and coding I believe can be a great asset to whatever project you are working on! :)   ",
